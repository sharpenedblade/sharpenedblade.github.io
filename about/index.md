# About

## This website

I write about topics related to linux, free software, and video games. If you spot an error or want to suggest an improvement, open an issue or send me an email. 

I made this website with [11ty](https://11ty.dev), markdown, and neovim.

## Contact Information

I will *try* to respond somewhat quickly, but I am somewhat busy right now. Please encrypt any sensitive information and attach your gpg key. If you do not get an response within 2 weeks, send your email again. **Do not** send spam or marketing to me, it is going to get blocked.
