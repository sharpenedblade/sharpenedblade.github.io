I write about interesting, fun, or plain helpful stuff. I currently maintain a Fedora remix for linux on T2 macs, though I dont have a lot of free time right now, so I might "disappear" for a while.

## Contact Information

I will _try_ to respond somewhat quickly, but I am somewhat busy right now. Please encrypt any sensitive information and attach your gpg key. _Please_ **do not** send "marketing" to me, it is going to get filtered anyways.
